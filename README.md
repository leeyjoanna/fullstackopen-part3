# FullStackOpen part 3: phonebook
Code is built progressively with each [exercise assignment](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3).
>"In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet."


Simple phonebook webpage that includes:
* live search
* add/delete
* edit through adding new entry with existing name
* pop up notification of changes 

Currently live on [Heroku](https://fso-pt3-phonebook.herokuapp.com/)
